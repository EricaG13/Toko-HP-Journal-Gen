# Toko-HP-Journal-Gen

An HTML generator custom made for the Tokotas ARPG. This simple-to-use website will take your database of Tokotas, and allow you to generate a pre-formatted HP Journal for any of your Tokotas with the click of a button! It should save you lots of time and maybe even some visits to corrections.

For more detail on what this program is meant to do, read the [Project Specifications](https://github.com/EricaG13/Toko-HP-Journal-Gen/tree/master/docs/PROJECT_SPECIFICATIONS.md).
