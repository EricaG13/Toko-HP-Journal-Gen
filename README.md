# Toko-HP-Journal-Gen

An HTML generator custom made for the Tokotas ARPG. This simple-to-use website will take your database of Tokotas, and allow you to generate a pre-formatted HP Journal for any of your Tokotas with the click of a button! It should save you lots of time and lots of visits to corrections.
